# highschool_web_tutorial
Project made for highschool in 2016. It was my TIC web project. Two webpages explaining basic concepts about html, css (with bootstrap) and javascript.

There are some errors and some bad practices but I wanted to keep it as it was at the time (except for the main index.html, which I changed slightly).
